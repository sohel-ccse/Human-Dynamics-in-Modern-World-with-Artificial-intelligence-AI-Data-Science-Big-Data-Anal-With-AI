#Resaerch into Action The Main goal of this Research Project is to Solve Some real world complex problems ----- Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. The machines are programmed to think and perform actions just like humans do. In this case, machines learn and solve problems through supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced learning. Machine Learning and Deep Learning fall under the purview of AI. Artificial Intelligence functions on massive amounts of data. Whether it’s through system matrix, web matrix, or social media, there’s no dearth of data about the market or the customers. All this acts as raw material for AI systems to make efficient decisions about marketing your product/service. Automating the marketing process helps in increasing sales - New-age marketing requires you to show those products to the customers that they want to see. #Artificial intelligence (AI),#Data Science,#Big Data,#cognitive Automation, #Deep Learning,#Computer Vision,#Human-machine interaction, #Machine Learning,#Innovations,#recommender system, #Natural Language Processing(NLP),#Speech, Pattern,Emotion and image recognition, #mathematics,#statistics,#Data visualization. -----------***---- Sample Resaerch Part:(Running) (*)"Fake-News-Detector With AI(NLP Algorithm)" (*)"Web traffic forecasting using time series Analysis(Deep Learning->RNN Model)" (*)"Predicting restaurant success With Machine Learning Algorithm" (*)"Non-parametriv Bayesian Statistics->Data Science &amp; Big Data"
